# Pong

This code is a partially completed version of the classic game "pong". Your
mission is to create a fully working one-player version that:

1. Has the ball move up/down and left/right
2. Has the ball bounce off the top, bottom, and right walls
3. Has the ball bounce off the paddle
4. Has a "score" variable that shows how many hits in a row the user has had
5. Resets the game and the "score" if the player misses the ball and it touches
   the left wall

To create "pong", you must do two things:
1. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIdk_vk-tgh7_RPmZKn8qJc9L8iSBRDWfoNWK-HW5TA)
   for installing `vscode`
2. Follow [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eW4la2fCusx_mdwDf4gEzEPu_daq-ZIVavT85ASw3pc)
   for modifying `main.py` to create "pong"
